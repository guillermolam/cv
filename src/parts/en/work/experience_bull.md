and backend components with a focus on performance, maintainability, and security.

_Key Contributions:_

- **Technology Stack:** Java/J2EE, JSP, Netijam Framework, Spring MVC, Web Services (SOAP/XML),
  Oracle SQL, jQuery, Maven, Hibernate.

- **Domain-Centric Development:** Delivered new features across the insurance lifecycle â€” from
  policy management, claims processing, and bordereaux generation to integration with loss adjusters

  filtering, metadata inheritance, and audit logging, streamlining the onboarding of new product
  lines.

- **Code Quality & CI:** Leveraged Maven plugins such as maven-checkstyle-plugin, maven-pmd-plugin,
  and maven-findbugs-plugin to enforce consistent code standards and detect common anti-patterns
  during builds.

- **Static Analysis & Security:** Introduced early SAST practices using tools like FindBugs with
  FindSecurityBugs extension to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, hardcoded
  credentials, and unvalidated inputs. Results were integrated into Jenkins pipelines to automate
  gatekeeping in the CI/CD process. Static Code Analysis with PMD and Checkstyle

- **Collaborative Development:** Used Git (migrated from SVN) for source control and branching
  strategies. Contributed to defining code review checklists incorporating linting compliance and
  security patterns.
